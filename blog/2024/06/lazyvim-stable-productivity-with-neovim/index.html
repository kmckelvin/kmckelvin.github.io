        <h1>LazyVim – Stable Productivity with Neovim</h1>
<p class="published-at">16 June 2024</p>

<div class="blog-post">
  <p>The Rails community is familiar with the Japanese term Omakase, as used to
describe the spirit of the Rails framework. It’s well covered in the
<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#omakase">Rails Doctrine</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you know what to order in a restaurant when you don’t know what’s good?
Well, if you let the chef choose, you can probably assume a good meal, even
before you know what “good” is. That is omakase. A way to eat well that
requires you neither be an expert in the cuisine nor blessed with blind luck
at picking in the dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s what <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim</a> brings to Neovim, courtesy of an
expert chef. Having spent many hours honing a Neovim configuration to suit my
taste, and tiring of the Sisyphean battle that comes with dealing with package
updates that break parts of your configuration (that you only notice days or
weeks after the breaking change), I was curious to see if this could alleviate
some of these pain points.</p>

<p>LazyVim provides a base configuration of plugins, keymaps, and settings for
Neovim that the author, Folke (or the chef to continue the Omakase analogy) has
refined to work together cohesively. Folke is one of the stalwards of the Neovim
community and has authored
<a href="https://github.com/folke?tab=repositories&amp;q=%23neovim-plugin">well over a dozen Neovim plugins</a>.
It’s incredibly liberating to pass the setup and maintenance responsibility of
my Neovim configuration to someone who knows the ins and outs of it far better
than I do, and who can keep that layer up to date over time.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://github.com/kmckelvin/nvimrc">built my own</a> Neovim configuration
from scratch before, but took the plunge to build a new configuration on top of
the LazyVim starter last week. After cloning the starter, and investing a little
effort in learning some new patterns and migrating some settings, I was able to
achieve a more refined, cohesive, and feature rich Neovim experience than my own
configuration I crafted from scratch over years. It took a bit of time to rewire
my brain around the new keymap mnemonics in LazyVim, but the reward was worth
the pain.</p>

<h2 id="the-optional-extras">The optional extras</h2>

<p>Fancy pairing a sauce with your meal? The chef has you covered. LazyVim has
“extras” for common configurations that can be enabled separately. These include
language specific configurations such as for Ruby, TypeScript or Go, but
cohesive configurations for linting, snippets and refactoring. It’s worth
enabling the appropriate extras for your workflow and learning their behaviour
instead of trying to configure these yourself.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-the-golden-path">Leaving the golden path</h2>

<p>Not everything the chef prepares will be to the liking of every patron. There
are a couple of changes I’ve made to LazyVim’s defaults:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve been using Tim Pope’s
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin with vim for well
over a decade, and I often prefer to open vim to use fugitive instead of the
git command line. I’ve switched out LazyGit to use Fugitive instead, and added
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb">vim-rhubarb</a> for better integration
with GitHub.</li>
  <li>I prefer the default behaviour of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">s</code> key so
<a href="https://github.com/kmckelvin/lazy-nvimrc/blob/master/lua/plugins/flash.lua">I’ve unbound it</a>
in folke/flash.nvim.</li>
  <li>I like having inline git blame, and
<a href="https://github.com/kmckelvin/lazy-nvimrc/blob/master/lua/plugins/gitsigns.lua">added the configuration</a>
to the gitsigns plugin.</li>
  <li>The keybindings in <code class="highlighter-rouge">kylechui/nvim-surround</code> work better in my mind than the
LazyVim extra has configured</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sticking-with-it">Sticking with it</h2>

<p>I’ve been using my new LazyVim-based configuration on Ruby, Go and TypeScript
codebases for some time now and I’m going to stick with it going forward. It’s
been a long time since I’ve felt this excited about an editor, and for it to
still be Neovim having used vim for over a decade is particularly satisfying. If
you’ve tried using vim before, but felt the burden of learning vimscript or lua
configure it wasn’t worthwhile, have a look at Neovim with LazyVim.</p>

<p>When I’m coding I don’t want to be distracted by issues with my text editor. If
Neovim gets in my way, I’d be better off using another tool. LazyVim with its
Lazy Extras, show great promise as a stable baseline that I can sprinkle a small
amount of custom settings over.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for some inspiration, I’ve
<a href="https://github.com/kmckelvin/lazy-nvimrc">pushed my configuration</a> to GitHub.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">lua/config</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">lua/plugins</code> contain the most interesting parts.</p>
