        <h1>Rails World 2025</h1>
<p class="published-at"> 7 September 2025</p>


<p>Rails World 2025, in Amsterdam, NL is a wrap! What an experience it‚Äôs been.</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt attended many conferences since before COVID. But this felt like a
rekindling of everything I remembered from being in the Ruby conference and user
group circuit in South Africa until 2017.</p>

<p>My visa meant I could only arrive on the morning of the first day of the
conference, and missed the pre-conference registration and drinks. But the
3:30AM wakeup for a 6AM flight from Newcastle to Schiphol, and the mad rush to
get from the arrivals gate to Beurs van Berlage was absolutely worth it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rails-world-2025/mcs.jpeg" alt="MCs" /></p>

<p>DHH was on typical passionate, enthusiastic form for his keynote. Citing ‚ÄúPax
Railsana‚Äù as we‚Äôre truly in the golden age of Rails, where we‚Äôre able to solve
the whole problem of web development. A slightly tangential demo of his Omarchy
Linux distribution was greatly enjoyed by the audience, who are by definition
already swayed to some degree by DHH‚Äôs aesthetic sensibilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basecamp/activerecord-tenanted">ActiveRecord::Tenanted</a> got
me the most excited. In essence, it takes the idea of sharding to the point
where every tenant in a multi-tenant system gets an entire isolated database.
It‚Äôs an idea I toyed with in about 2017 or 2018, but abandoned because of the
sheer number of edges I ran into with the likes of migrations, schema version
management between databases, identifying which database to read for background
workers, connection pooling, and what to do with the data that should be shared
between accounts. I‚Äôm excited to see where this new gem goes, and if I can help
contribute to it.</p>

<p>Aaron Patterson‚Äôs signature pun-filled, trolling keynote closed out the
conference. 30_001 assertions, a ton of laughs, and a dive into ZJIT later, and
we were all left truly excited for the future of both Ruby, and of Rails. All of
us owe Shopify a massive debt of gratitude for the work they put in to building
world class tooling for Ruby.</p>

<p>I could wax lyrical about the quality of the talks, and they were truly
fantastic, but the best part of attending a conference like Rails World in
person is meeting people. I reconnected with old colleagues from South Africa,
and international Ruby friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in a decade since I was involved in
the Rubyfuza conference in Cape Town. As well as new acquaintances I had only
recently met at the Brighton Ruby conference earlier in 2025.</p>

<p>The sponsors were on top form too. Framework was there demoing their laptops and
desktop. Rails staples such as Intercom, GitHub, GitLab, Basecamp, Sentry were
all there supporting the conference and community. Thanks in particular to
Cedarcode who sponsored barista coffee for the conference!</p>

<p>Shopify put on the after party at the ridiculously fun STRAAT Museum, with ‚ÄúOff
The Rails‚Äù Pale Ale, drinks, food and music. Being in a room with a few hundred
friends, where you could walk up to anyone and strike up a conversation and find
common ground is an experience I won‚Äôt forget in a hurry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rails-world-2025/off-the-rails.jpeg" alt="Off The Rails Pale Ale" /></p>

<p>Amanda Perino and the crew at the Rails Foundation who put together the
conference deserve a massive round of applause, and I hope they‚Äôre all able to
relax after a job well done. The attention to detail in organisation was
spectacular, from the choice of the venue, to having a cloakroom (and luggage
store for those of us who could only arrive on the day), to having apple juice
served in wine glasses and top quality barista coffee. Thank you üëè.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt wait for the next one in Austin, TX. See you there üçª</p>
