<p>When I’m not coding, one of my favourite pastimes is playing guitar. It gives me
a creative outlet that requires consistent and disciplined practice in order to
progress. In the beginning I spent days learning the absolute basics, such as
changing chords. Playing a D chord was easy, but going from C to D to G? That
was murder. I was able to actually play a simple four-chord song after a few
weeks of practice — barring a couple of slip-ups. But that was really only the
beginning. Every skill acquired opened the door to a more advanced skill, but
jumping to something more advanced without first mastering the basics would have
slowed my overall progress. It would have been unwise to learn barre chords
(where you shift a chord pattern up or down the fretboard by blocking off the
lowest notes of each string with your index finger) without first learning to
play the basic chord patterns.</p>

<p>Technique and muscle memory take time to master. It’s also easy to learn the
wrong things and then have to undo the learning later. When I learned to employ
vibrato (rapidly stretching and releasing the tension of a string to shift a
note’s pitch) I had some poor technique that would likely have given me an RSI
(repetitive strain injury) within a couple of years. Thankfully a friend of mine
(a professional studied musician) noticed my poor technique and helped me to
correct it. You see, I had practiced, even worked with discipline to get it
right, but I had not perfected it.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom fails here. <strong>Practice doesn’t necessarily make perfect.
Practice makes permanent.</strong> Only perfect practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>Now this is all well when it comes to music, but I believe this applies equally
to us as software engineers. A musician doesn’t walk on stage and perform
without first due practice and preparation for the concert. At least, if they
do, they run the risk of jeopardising their career and reputation, and ruining
opportunities for further performance.</p>

<p>If we see ourselves as craftsmen and craftswomen, and take pride in our work, I
believe we need to do the same. We should practice our techniques and hone our
craft so that when we have to “perform,” the muscle memory is there. Muscle
memory lets us do good work without expending mental energy on the technique,
and allows us to put all of our energy into doing a good job.</p>

<p>Now there are many good ways of practicing, but I have a few suggestions that
have worked well for me throughout my career.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code Retreats</strong>: Corey Haines developed this format of a day of disciplined
practice where you pair up and work on Conway’s Game of Life. The pressure of
deadlines is removed by imposing a 45-minute cutoff, after which you delete
all the code you’ve just written — there’s no expectation that you actually
finish building Game of Life. This liberates you to experiment with different
approaches and techniques throughout the day. I can point to production code
I’ve written (that’s stood the test of time) where I’ve applied lessons
learned directly from doing a dozen Code Retreats. Find a craftsmanship group
near you and run a Code Retreat! (<a href="http://coderetreat.org/">http://coderetreat.org/</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code Katas</strong>: Similarly to how a kata in martial arts involves a series of
defined steps to move from a beginning position to an ending position, a code
kata is a well-defined problem that is intended to be repeated frequently.
There’s a library of good katas at <a href="http://codekata.com/">http://codekata.com/</a>. Once you’ve
mastered a solution to a code kata, you’re free to experiment with new
techniques, or impose further constraints on your solution that can lead to
interesting patterns and learnings. For example, what happens if you try write
Conway’s Game of Life without ‘if’ conditions? Or what about not passing bare
primitives? Or perhaps try solve it in a new language you aren’t familiar
with, which leads us to…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learning new languages</strong>: Language gives us the ability to express our
thoughts and opinions. By learning new programming languages you’ll be exposed
to new and different ways of expressing yourself. Often languages will impose
limitations in order to make gain elsewhere — and identifying those tradeoffs
can be beneficial to your day-to-day work. If you’re looking for some
inspiration, try implementing a familiar code kata in a new language. Rust and
Clojure are both pretty exciting at the moment!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, practice doesn’t make perfect. Practice makes permanent. Perfect
practice makes perfect. Take the time to hone and practice your skills outside
of work, so that you can be in top form when it’s your turn to perform!</p>
